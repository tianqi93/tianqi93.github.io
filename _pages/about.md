Hi and thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹ I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) and my areas of interest include semantic representation, mental lexicon, and individual differences in these domains. Using computational models (deep neural network and complex network) and psycholinguistic experimentation (behavioral and EEG), I intend to understand how words are acquired, organized, and retrieved from long-term memory. I also study the development of these processes in different populations (e.g., older vs. younger adults, cognitively impaired vs. intact elderly, bilingual vs. monolingual speakers).

In HKU, I am supervised by Dr. [Manwa Lawrence Ng](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/manwa) and Dr. [Guang Ouyang](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/ouyangg) at Speech and Hearing. I am also advised by Prof. [Xu Xu](https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Data/View/2619) at SJTU Linguistics, and we recently have a series of publications (some are on the way).

Prior to HKU, I was working in a very different field (although it was language-related) and received my Masterâ€™s degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). Some of my experience and knowledge in NLP and EEG was accumulated while working as a research assistant at the Laboratory of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems, [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.siat.ac.cn/) (Advisor: Prof. [Nan Yan](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~yannan), Prof. [Lan Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0008839)).


**OPEN TO WORK** ðŸ’¼ I'm looking for a postdoc or AP postion in psycholinguistics and related fields (e.g., cognitive science, psychology, communication science and disorder).
