I obtained my PhD degree in Cognitive Science at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) and I worked on computational psycholinguistics. My areas of interest include lexical and semantic representation, as well as individual differences in terms of mental lexicon. To understand the *how* and the *why* within these topics, I use a combination of computational modeling and human experiments. For a longer overview of my research, click [here](https://tianqi93.github.io/research/) [(中文版)](https://tianqi93.github.io/research_zh/).

💼 I was recently offered a faculty position at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and I will work in Chengdu 🐼 very soon.
