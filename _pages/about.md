I am currently a final-year PhD student working on computational psycholinguistics at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My areas of interest include lexical and semantic representation, as well as individual differences in terms of mental lexicon. To understand the *how* and the *why* within these topics, I use a combination of computational modeling and human experiments. For a longer overview of my research, click [here](https://tianqi93.github.io/research/).

**OPEN TO WORK** ðŸ’¼ I'm looking for a postdoc or AP postion in psycholinguistics and related fields (e.g., cognitive science, psychology, communication science and disorder).
