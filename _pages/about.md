Hi and thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹ I am currently a fifth-year PhD student working on computational psycholinguistics at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My areas of interest include lexical and semantic representation, as well as individual differences in terms of mental lexicon. To understand the *how* and the *why* within these topics, I use a combination of psycholinguistic experimentation and computational models. For a longer overview of my research, click [here](https://tianqi93.github.io/research/).

In HKU, I am supervised by Prof. [Manwa Lawrence Ng](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/manwa) and Prof. [Guang Ouyang](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/ouyangg). I am also advised by Prof. [Xu Xu](https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Data/View/2619) at [STJU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). Prior to doctoral study, I was working at the Laboratory of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems in Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I was supervised by Prof. [Nan Yan](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~yannan) and Prof. [Lan Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0008839).

**OPEN TO WORK** ðŸ’¼ I'm looking for a postdoc or AP postion in psycholinguistics and related fields (e.g., cognitive science, psychology, communication science and disorder).
