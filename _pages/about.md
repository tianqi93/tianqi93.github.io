Hi and thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹ I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) and my areas of interest include semantic representation and mental lexicon. Using psycholinguistic experimentation (behavioral and EEG) and computational models (deep neural network and complex network), I intend to understand how words are acquired, organized, and retrieved, as well as the development of these processes in cognitively impaired aging adults.

I am advised by Dr. [Manwa Lawrence Ng](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/manwa) and Dr. [Guang Ouyang](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/ouyangg) at HKU Speech and Hearing, as well as Prof. [Xu Xu](https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Data/View/2619) at SJTU Linguistics. Prior to HKU, I received my Masterâ€™s degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I also spent a year as a research assistant at [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.siat.ac.cn/), where I was advised by Prof. [Nan Yan](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~yannan) and Prof. [Lan Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0008839).


**OPEN TO WORK** ðŸ’¼ I'm looking for a postdoc or AP postion in psycholinguistics and related fields.
