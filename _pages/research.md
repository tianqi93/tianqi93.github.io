My current research centers on the intersection of psycholinguistics and natural language processing. More concretely, I use a combination of computational modeling and human experiments to understand how words are organized and retrieved, as well as how individuals are different in terms of their mental lexicon. Topics of my research include compositionality, lexical ambiguity, and lifespan changes in lexical semantic representation. Below are some of the specific projects I work on during my doctoral study.

##### **Project 1: A Computational characterization of Chinese compound processing**

This study provided a computational characterization for the dual-route framework of compound processing. To do so, we first trained a computational model to learn the complex rules of Chinese word formation. After training, the model could capture the role-dependent meanings of the constituent characters, which were further combined nonlinearly to generate the compound wordâ€™s compositional representation. Based on the actual and model-predicted representations, we defined two metrics to characterize (i) the extent to which the compositional meaning converges with the lexicalized meaning (i.e., compound **_compositionality_**), and (ii) the extent to which the compositional representation has a **_distinct_** presence in semantic space and thus can be readily activated during compound processing. Analyses on lexical decision and eye-tracking data revealed the main effects of the composition metrics, which indicated an active engagement of the combinatorial process in compound processing. Moreover, these compositional effects appeared to be dampened with the increase of compound frequency, i.e., an indicator of whether the whole-word meaning can be easily retrieved from semantic memory. The present study can serve as a theoretical and methodological extension to dual-route framework of compound processing. In a more general sense, findings in this study illuminate how meaning composition is implemented in minds and machines.
