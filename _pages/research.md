My current research centers on the intersection of psycholinguistics and natural language processing. More concretely, I use a combination of psycholinguistic experimentation and computational models to understand how words are organized and retrieved, as well as how individuals are different in terms of their mental lexicon. Topics of my research include compositionality, lexical ambiguity, and lifespan changes in lexical semantic representation. Below are some of the specific projects I work on during my PhD study.
