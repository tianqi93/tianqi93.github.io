##### **Neural dynamics of the compositional process in Chinese compound processing: Analyses on a mega-scale database**
___

Previous studies have shown that in Chinese compound recognition, a meaning-composition process is routinely implemented over the constituent characters (i.e., morphemes). Yet, it is poorly understood how this compositional process unfolds over time. In this study, we trained a computational model to account for morphemic combination. Based on the compositional representation derived from the model, we defined two computed metrics to characterize (i) the extent to which the compositional meaning converges with the lexicalized meaning (i.e., **_compositionality_**), and (ii) the extent to which the compositional representation has a distinct presence in semantic space (i.e., **_distinctness_** of the compositional meaning) and thus can be readily activated during compound processing. Analyses on an ERP megastudy of Chinese word recognition (Tsang & Zou, 2022) revealed that the two properties of the compositional representation affected ERP amplitudes in different time windows:\ higher **_distinctness_** was associated with smaller negativity at the intermediate stage (roughly corresponding to the N400 time window) of compound processing, attributable to the fewer number of lexicalized distractors and thus relative ease of semantic access. At the later stage of compound processing (roughly corresponding to the LPC/P600), both higher **_distinctness_** and higher **_compositionality_** were associated with attenuated positivity, thanks to the ease of generating a holistic representation of the compound. Implications of integrating mega-scale databases and computational modeling for research on language processing will be discussed.

##### **A primed lexical decision megastudy for Chinese characters**
___

In this study, we report lexical decision data for 1,864 Chinese characters that are primed by character associates. That is, the prime character and the target character often combine to form multi-character words. In addition to the behavioral measures, the database provides rich psycholinguistic information such as lexicosemantic properties of prime and target characters, those of their word formations, as well as the associative strength between prime and target characters. Trial-level analyses have shown that target characters in the priming condition were processed faster and more accurately while the properties of prime and target characters were simultaneously taken into account. Item-level analyses further revealed that the size of priming effect was influenced by the properties of prime and target characters, the primesâ€™ position within word formations, as well as the prime-target associative strength. This database could thus complement previous megastudies on isolated Chinese word/character recognition (e.g., MEgastudy of Lexical Decision in Simplified CHinese; Tsang et al., 2018, the Chinese Lexicon Project for Chinese characters; Sze et al., 2014, and the Chinese Lexicon Project for Chinese compound words; Tse et al., 2017), allowing us to explore the relationships between words and characters as well as their consequences for how character recognition is accomplished. Potential applications of the database are discussed.
