    abastract = {Word affective ratings are important tools in psycholinguistic research, natural language processing, and many other fields.
However, even for well-studied languages, such norms are usually limited in scale. To extrapolate affective (i.e., valence
and arousal) values for words in the SUBTLEX-CH database (Cai & Brysbaert, 2010, PLoS ONE, 5(6):e10729), we implemented
a computational neural network which captured how words’ vector-based semantic representations corresponded to
the probability densities of their valence and arousal. Based on these probability density functions, we predicted not only
a word’s affective values, but also their respective degrees of variability that could characterize individual differences in
human affective ratings. The resulting estimates of affective values largely converged with human ratings for both valence
and arousal, and the estimated degrees of variability also captured important features of the variability in human ratings. We
released the extrapolated affective values, together with their corresponding degrees of variability, for over 38,000 Chinese
words in the Open Science Framework (https:// osf. io/ s9zmd/). We also discussed how the view of embodied cognition could
be illuminated by this computational model.},
