        abstract  = {Most Chinese words are compounds formed through the combination of meaningful characters. Yet, due to compositional complexity, it is poorly understood how this combinatorial process affects the access to the whole-word meaning. In the present study, we turned to the recent development in compositional distributional semantics (Marelli et al., 2017), and employed a deep neural network to learn the less-than-systematic relationship between the constituent characters and the compound words. Based on the compositional representations derived from the computational model, we quantified compositionality as the degree of overlap between the compositional and the lexicalized representations as well as the degree of distinctness of the compositional representation. We observed that these two compositional attributes can affect compound recognition over and above the effects of constituent character features and compound features. Moreover, we found that this effect was increasingly stronger when holistic access to the compound meaning became more challenging. These findings therefore, from a computational perspective, provided new evidence for the combinatorial process involved in Chinese word recognition, which also shed light on the universal process of compound comprehension.},

    abastract = {Word affective ratings are important tools in psycholinguistic research, natural language processing, and many other fields.
However, even for well-studied languages, such norms are usually limited in scale. To extrapolate affective (i.e., valence
and arousal) values for words in the SUBTLEX-CH database (Cai & Brysbaert, 2010, PLoS ONE, 5(6):e10729), we implemented
a computational neural network which captured how words’ vector-based semantic representations corresponded to
the probability densities of their valence and arousal. Based on these probability density functions, we predicted not only
a word’s affective values, but also their respective degrees of variability that could characterize individual differences in
human affective ratings. The resulting estimates of affective values largely converged with human ratings for both valence
and arousal, and the estimated degrees of variability also captured important features of the variability in human ratings. We
released the extrapolated affective values, together with their corresponding degrees of variability, for over 38,000 Chinese
words in the Open Science Framework (https:// osf. io/ s9zmd/). We also discussed how the view of embodied cognition could
be illuminated by this computational model.},
